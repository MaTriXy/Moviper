#Viper-framework TODOs:
 - update the readme, cleanup the migration guide
 - take a closer look at the new samples (service-vipers, independent vipers)
 - take a closer look at the idea of creating base bound and started VIPER Services.
  - add missing viper viewholders types
     - add ai/passive butterknife/databinding recyclerview viewholders
     - add viewhelper recyclerview viewholders
 - independent vipers: shall we create the in-lib singleton to keep their references to keep them alive independently of any components?
 - add registering callback presenters to ipc
 - allow users not to use ipc in presenters (not even importing - now every presenter tries to registered to ipc)
 - shall we rethink the way of the creation of vipers? Maybe we should create a "Builder" component that will abstract-out the creation of VIPERs?
 - shall we develop some kind of direct communication and management of vipers (I mean non-ipc)?
  - split moviper to modules
     - split moviper-common to have the viewstate classes separately (like in mosby)
     - remove recyclerview dependency from presenters dispatcher module
     - split the lib to:
        - core
        - rx
        - standard
        - ipc (with rxjava)
        - viewhelper
        - presentersDispatcher
        - ai
            - butterknife
            - databinding
        - passive
            - butterknife
            - databinding
        - kotlin
     -  AS Plugin:
        - Kotlin versions
