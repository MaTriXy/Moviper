#Viper-framework TODOs:
 - add ai/passive butterknife/databinding recyclerview viewholders
 - remove recyclerview dependency from presenters dispatcher module
 - add registering callback presenters to ipc
 - allow users not to use ipc in presenters (not even importing - now every presenter is registered to ipc)
 - split moviper-common to have the viewstate classes separately (like in mosby)
 - add viewhelper recyclerview viewholders
 - add sample showcasing multiple passive presenters attached to one view
 - develop service vipers without view
    - shall they have lifecycle similar to the view ones? or maybe completely different
 - develop application context attached vipers without view allowing to create independent, self sustainable vipers
    - shall they have lifecycle similar to the view ones? or maybe completely different?
        - actually, they won't be bound to any lifecycle-driven component, so probably not
    - shall we create the singleton to keep their references to keep them alive independently of any components?
 - shall we rethink the way of the creation of vipers?
 - shall we develop some kind of direct communication and management of vipers (I mean non-ipc)
 - split the lib to:
    - core
    - rx
    - standard
    - ipc (with rxjava)
    - presentersDispatcher
    - ai / passive ?
    - butterknife
    - databinding
    - kotlin
 -  AS Plugin:
    - Kotlin versions
    - Ai, Butterknife, DataBinding
